Veneficus Mini is **Full kill-chain malware 0day: Exploit, LPE, Pivot, C2, Persistence**.

This repository is a **documentation clone** of that Windows x64 kit - sketched as a modular agent covering the whole chain: host scoring, concealment, a signed-driver helper pool (exploit / LPE), lateral coerce plus a loopback relay (pivot), an HTTPS edge control plane (C2), and WMI / task / Run-key stay-resident (persistence), plus harvest.

Every module here is **pseudo-code**. It is not a buildable project, not a dropper, and not a detector-friendly dump of a private tree.

| Kept | Removed / aliased |
| --- | --- |
| Product name **Veneficus** | Private function names, types, env vars |
| Public **CVE** identifiers | Vendor product names, exploit nicknames |
| Design, including defects | Driver filenames, device paths, control codes |
| | Host artifacts, XOR keys, patch bytes, regexes |
| | Private relay path strings |

Identifiers in this packet are aliases. A copy of these files should not compile into a YARA rule that hits a private implementation.

## Kill chain

| Stage | What it covers in this outline |
| --- | --- |
| **Exploit** | Dropper, signed-driver helper pool, in-process patches |
| **LPE** | Vulnerable-driver primitives, debug privilege, PPL-adjacent dump path |
| **Pivot** | Auth coerce / relay sketch, loopback SOCKS-like proxy |
| **C2** | HTTPS edge relay, sealed beacons, operator job queue |
| **Persistence** | WMI pulse, on-logon task, machine Run key |

## Intended flow

<img src="docs/flow.png" alt="Dropper, score, conceal, harvest, hold" width="100%">

1. **Dropper** — quiet the script engine, `GET /payload`, write a throwaway-named image under the user temp directory, start it hidden.
2. **Score** — debugger / hypervisor / hardware / idle / timing / outbound checks. High → wipe and exit. Medium → quiet mode (host card only). Low → full operation.
3. **Conceal** — native-call path (stub), stack-cover (imported, unused), kernel hide (stub), in-process script-scan and telemetry patches (intent is real; bytes omitted).
4. **Driver pool** — try signed-but-vulnerable kernel images as a process-kill helper. Needs admin. Images are not in this repository.
5. **Harvest** — host card, browser logins, OS secret-store dump, clipboard swap. Cookie harvest exists and is never called.
6. **Hold** — WMI pulse / on-logon task / machine Run key, loopback relay, blank view listener, control poll with jitter.

## Module status

The private tree is unfinished. This outline keeps the defects visible on purpose.

## CVE references

Vendor names withheld. Role names are aliases.

| CVE | Role in the pool | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2025-1055 / CVE-2025-52915 | AV kernel scanner | Process-kill control code |
| CVE-2024-51324 | Third-party AV utility driver | Process-kill control code |
| CVE-2025-7771 | CPU-tuning driver | Real primitive is physmem R/W, not pid-kill |
| CVE-2025-70795 | DLP process-monitor driver | Process-kill control code |
| CVE-2019-16098 | GPU overlay driver | Virtual R/W; private tree used the wrong code |
| CVE-2025-33073 | SMB client (lateral sketch) | Cited, not implemented; dead code |

## Edge relay

<img src="docs/control.png" alt="Agent, edge worker, and operator routes" width="100%">

Public path aliases: `/payload` `/inbox` `/queue` `/profile` `/ops` `/enroll` `/revoke` `/roster` `/profile/set`.

Sealed blobs use AES-256-GCM. The channel key is derived from the compile-time agent id with no salt — possession of the binary implies possession of the key. The worker never decrypts. Jobs travel in the clear.

## What this is not

- Not a compiler input. `.pseudo` files will not build.
- Not the private tree. Native-call, kernel hide, hidden view, and auth-coerce are stubs or dead code **in this outline**; the kit itself is Full kill-chain malware 0day: Exploit, LPE, Pivot, C2, Persistence.
- Not a vulnerability disclosure beyond the public CVE IDs listed above.
